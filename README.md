# Breakout Neural Network
This project was inspired by one of Deepmind's early presentations: an AI 
capable of mastering breakout through Deep Q-Learning. The game itself was built 
using the [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/docs/) library. The AI is built using 
[NEAT](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.cec02.pdf), an algorithm 
made for implementing a neural network. The documentation for the NEAT python 
package can be found 
[here](https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/neat_overview.html). The 
specific configuration of NEAT in this project is similar to that of a [Flappy
Bird AI tutorial by Tech with Tim](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzMcBGfZo4-lwGZWXz5Qgta_YNX3_vLS2)
