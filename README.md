# Breakout Neural Network
This project was inspired by one of Deepmind's early presentations: an AI capable of mastering breakout 
through Deep Q-Learning. The game itself was built using the [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/docs/) library. 
The AI is built using [NEAT](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.cec02.pdf), an algorithm meant 
for implementing a neural network. The documentation for the NEAT python package can be found 
[here](https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/neat_overview.html)
